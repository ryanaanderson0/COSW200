                <p>ReactJS is the most popular and loved web framework, according to the Stack Overflow survey (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019).

                <p>ReactJS community: <a href="https://dev.to/t/react">DEV's React Community<a/></p>

                <p>ReactJS has an extremely active community with over a million users. I searched through a few ReactJS communities and found that dev.to/t/react was one of the best, with over 5000 posts published. The commuity has ReactJS help discussions, links to tutorial docs and Live Feed videos of React Conferences. This ReactJS community looks to be very active and knowlegeable about the intricucies of ReactJS. </p>
