			<h2>About Me</h2>
			
			<p>Ryan Anderson is a budding Web Developer currently studying at Long Beach City College. After many years sweating in kitchens and working long nights, Ryan decided to make a career change to join the tech industry. </p>

			<p>During his semester in COSW-10, he learned how to create clean and concise code, choose a color palette that supports the subject of the website, and form a layout that is pleasing to the eye.</p>

			<p>His goal for the upcoming semesters is to continue adding concepts and techniques as well as further his knowledge of Web Design by learning Javascript, JQuery, Word Press designs, etc. </p>

			<h2>Future</h2>
			
			<p>After Ryan finishes his A.S. in Web Development from LBCC, he plans on applying for a Junior Web Development position to gain working experience in the field and hopefully cultivate a career in the industry. He also intends on using the knowledge he has learned selfishly, creating websites for his own side projects such as his baking company, Rye Rye Bread Co.
